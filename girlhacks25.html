    <h1>Gaia - GirlHacks25</h1>
    <div class="description">
        <p>
            Gaia won 1st place at GirlHacks 25. It's a web application with a dynamic AI chatbot designed to support
            women on campus by connecting them with resources, guidance, and community! 🌟 Inspired by Greek goddesses,
            the platform begins with a chat with Gaia—the source of all life. From there, users can connect with the
            goddess they need most: Athena for wisdom and academics, Artemis for mentorship and independence, Aphrodite
            for confidence and empowerment, Tyche for scholarships, or Gaia for general support.
            <br>
            Each goddess searches the web to provide relevant answers and resources—whether it’s events from
            Highlander Hub, research being conducted at NJIT, tutorials from YouTube, tutoring services on campus, and
            more. Students can log in securely, access curated NJIT resources, and find encouragement through a
            goddess-inspired mentorship experience that ensures they’re never alone.
            <br><br>
            Frontend: React, Vite, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
            Backend: Python, Gemini AI, Azure AI, MongoDB, Auth0, FastAPI, BeautifulSoup
            <br><br>
            I worked on python scripts to scrape and process the data so it could be used by our RAG, built with Azure
            AI. I incorporated Gemini API to tag the data more intelligently. I also contributed to the design process
            and helped plan and manage the project.
