        <p>
            My team at HackPrinceton (Fall '25) built Rescura because no one should face health emergencies alone.
            Our goal is simple yet powerful: to turn every phone into a digital first responder that recognises
            signs of distress, guides lifesaving action, and calls for help when humans can’t.
            <br>
            Rescura was born from compassion and urgency, designed to make technology serve humanity where it’s
            needed most.
            <br><br>
            Rescura detects early warning signs of cardiac emergencies and acts autonomously to protect lives.
            <br>
            Real-time monitoring: Analyses ECG and motion data to identify dangerous patterns such as arrhythmia,
            immobility, or sudden impact.
            <br>
            Instant response: When risk is high, Rescura triggers SOS alerts with location data and begins calm,
            step-by-step CPR coaching for bystanders.
            <br>
            Disaster resilience: During natural disasters or network outages, Rescura enters SOS Mode, continuing
            to monitor offline devices and queue alerts until connectivity is restored.
            <br>
            Accessible safety: Designed for low-power, low-bandwidth environments, this technology brings intelligent
            emergency response to places where it has never been before.
            <br><br>
            Rescura doesn’t diagnose; it empowers. It bridges the gap between danger and help, giving every person a
            fighting chance.
            <br><br>
            On the technical side, we used signal processing, machine learning (LightGBM), and integrated Grok as our
            AI agent, enabling real-time reasoning, response generation, and adaptive decision-making during emergencies.
            Our stack included Python, React, ESP32, Arduino, and Chart.js, using data from the MIT-BIH ECG and WEDA-FALL
            datasets.
            <br><br>
            I converted our fall data to 125Hz format from 5 to 50Hz data and generated synthetic data while incorporating
            error handling into all methods. I worked on fine-tuning LGBM parameters. I collaborated on pitch development
            and presentation.
