        <p>
            Finsense is a personalized financial research assistant that helps users make sense of market 
            uncertainty by combining live market data, news events, and risk analysis. Instead of giving 
            investment advice, it highlights what areas of the market are worth researching based on current 
            conditions and a user's preferences.
            <br><br>
            The system is built around an AI agent that reasons about information, supported by modular MCP 
            (Model Context Protocol) servers that provide reliable data and analytics. I developed three 
            specialized MCP servers: <strong>mcp_market</strong> processes market data to understand sector 
            and stock performance, providing historical returns and price summaries; <strong>mcp_news</strong> 
            retrieves relevant news headlines and extracts risk-related themes from unstructured text, mapping 
            these themes to affected sectors; and <strong>mcp_risk</strong> analyzes inter-sector relationships, 
            correlations, and volatility to identify how risk can spread across the market.
            <br><br>
            I implemented the entire backend infrastructure using FastAPI, integrating the MCP servers with 
            an intelligent coordinator agent that orchestrates multi-source financial analysis. The project 
            utilizes yfinance for real-time market data, RSS feed parsing for news aggregation, and custom 
            sentiment analysis algorithms. I also built a responsive web interface with JavaScript that 
            communicates with the backend API, deployed on Vercel with the API hosted on Render. The system 
            demonstrates advanced capabilities in asynchronous Python programming, API design, and creating 
            practical AI-powered financial tools.
